                <p>
                    Hello! I am Ross Ferguson. Currently, I am a Physics teacher living and working on the east coast of
                    Scotland. At present, I am developing my skills as a full-stack web developer by completing a
                    Full-stack Bootcamp offered by <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/"
                        target="_blank">HyperionDev</a> and the <a
                        href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/bayes/about-us/education/hyperiondev-coding-bootcamps"
                        target="_blank">University of
                        Edinburgh.</a>
                    <br>
                    As a teacher and self-certified geek, I am extremely passionate about the use of technology in the
                    classroom and how we can develop and foster our young people to become the developers and engineers
                    of the future.
                    <br>
                    In terms of design, I am inspired by simple colour schemes with bold splashes of colour. I also
                    enjoy retro and space-inspired themes taking inspiration from sci-fi books and movies.
                    <br>
                    My goal in the future is to combine my passion for education and teaching with my newfound passion
                    for web development. I would love to work for a company that shared these passions and endeavoured to
                    provide a first-class user experience.

                        As a teacher, I have excellent communication skills. I am confident in using different types and

                        I began my career as a teacher just as Scottish Education was in the middle of a transition from
                        Standard Grades and Intermediates to National 4/5 and the new CfE Highers. As such I have
                        developed and honed my skills in the course development as much of my early career was spent
                        creating new schemes of work to match the courses and refining them with student feedback.

                        As a class teacher, I am responsible for planning and assessing all classes on my timetable. At
                        present, I also assist in the analysis of attainment data and as such, I am an active member of
                        the attainment working group. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I took on a lead role in staff,
                        pupil and parent development concerning the use of Google Classroom and the apps for education.
                        I empowered our teachers and learners to make use of the resources available to them to ensure
                        learning was as undisrupted as possible.

                        I also played an active part in the rolling out of Chromebooks to the school and in training
                        staff on how to use them.

                <p>As a web developer my most recent and personally rewarding project has been to create an online store
                    for a fictional business.
                    <br>
                    The store had to meet several criteria such as;
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Have a functional shopping cart
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allow customers to apply a working coupon and update the total to reflect the change
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have a page which shows the cart
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Allow the user to select a delivery method and update the total cost to reflect the cost of
                            the method chosen
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Have an individual page for each product
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    I also decided to challenge myself by making it so that I would have one page for the products and this
                    would update depending on which item from the catalogue the user had selected.
                    <br>
                    I managed to achieve all of the above receiving full marks and positive comments from the code
                    the reviewer who had reviewed my work.
                    <br>
                    I am happy to share the full project on GitHub if requested.
